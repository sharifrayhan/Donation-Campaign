Just click on the card and it'll take you to the details page where you will find the donation option. All the donations info are fetched from an API and dynamically shown on homepage.

• **Donated Info Page and Statistics :** All the donated information are stored in localstorage and shown in donation page using localstorage functions like get item and set item. You will also find a statistics page where the number of total donation options and all donation made are shown in percentage with the help of a library called recharts.
